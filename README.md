## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

For this project I tried to focus on mobile-first design, while I did the design for desktop using Grid for both columns and for giving it an specific
order different than mobile. For elements like headings I used flexbox.

### Continued development

For the next project I wanna improve my grid skills, and also put more effort in make it responsive
